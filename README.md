# TextVisualizer
TextVisualizer R Package by Steven Luu

This is an R package designed to help users easily create bar graphs that help visualize what the most commonly occuring word is in a user's input text.

User texts are cleaned and processed before visualization in order to ensure the accuracy of the end product.

# Example and Usage:
To create a visual, the command is: visual_function(input) where input is any string or string vector. 

This is an example using Abraham Lincoln's "Gettysburg Address"
